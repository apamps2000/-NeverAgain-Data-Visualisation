# -NeverAgain-Data-Visualisation
Social media offers ordinary citizens with a platform to push for policy reforms and advocacy. Such was the case with the Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where in February of 2018, a lone gunman opened fire on several students of the school, killing 17 and injuring many others. The incidence led to an outcry from concerned Americans, leading to several school walk-outs and an online campaign by some of the affected students using the hashtag never again (#NeverAgain).
Data was collected from Twitter using #NeverAgain over a period of 100 days, and was subjected to data visualization and social network analyses in Tableau and Gephi respectively. The results revealed that the #NeverAgain campaign trended heavily on Twitter thereby influencing the civil society to the extent that legislations were passed in the state of Florida within the first 100 days of the campaign on social media.
